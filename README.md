# UE4-charcter-action-system
By using Unreal engine 4, building character action system, including character's interaction with environment, dynamical mesh destruction special effect will be fired when hit events and overlap events was be triggered. Also creating simple character audio system to dynamically vary sound with different pitch and volume at run time.  
## Project Section
* 01 Prepare environmental assets.
* 02 Version Control and ignore Unreal derived files.
* 03 Project has reached quite far. So the current progress is that character could destroy the destructible mesh. Character's two fist melee attack actions were created. Creating Unreal Datatable to store the character's animation montages more effectively.  
* 04 Implementing sound effect by using animNotify class and animNotifyState class. 
* 05 Slightly refine the physical feedback when the character collide with other objects.
